Switch to hiragana (Windows IME) in one click, write macrons on your native keyboard easily (+ extra, write spanish characters)

Microsoft IME keyboard is garbage, I know it, you know it, they know it. 
But using a special input forcing Hiragana, you can easily do what Microsoft never did! Switch to hiragana without the need of your mouse!

Since I write in japanese AND write about japanese stuff in english, I've been missing the macron characters on my keyboard, those special characters are the ones gaving their name to the app (well, and also, ******** ******)
For those who wouldn't know, there are two ways to write "ou" in Romaji, "ou" and "≈ç" which, in my opinion, looks way better.

My dad has been struggling to type spanish characters on french keyboard, so, I allowed myself to add Paco-chan to the repo!

It's a very basic script done with AHK and converted to .exe.

To have it running on your computer on boot, store the .exe in a safe location, then create a shortcut and place it the folder appearing after clicking [Win+R], then shell:startup.
This is the folder with the apps running on the boot of your computer!

Cheers!
